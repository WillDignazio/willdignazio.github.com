### id slackwill
The nick/username slackwill comes from his first endeavours in Linux. Will was first introduced to Linux with the 
<a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> distribution, by his friend <a href="http://ehouse.us.com/">Ethan House</a>, 
and was dubbed "slackwill" for his affinity for it at the time. He regrets nothing. His current preference for Linux distribution however,
is <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> or <a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>.
