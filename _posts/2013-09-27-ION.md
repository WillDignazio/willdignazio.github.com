I've been reading various papers and abstracts on clustering concepts, as well
as some material on quorum (Paxos) and cluster management. A couple relevant 
things have popped up over the past couple days, namely 
[Ballast](http://people.nas.nasa.gov/~kolano/projects/ballast.html), a SSH load
balancing system, and [ION](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ion-dtn/). 

I'll cover some more on Ballast later, though for now I wanted to write a little
about how cool and interesting ION is. 

## Stop Looking At Your Feet!

I'm a fan of emerging or underappreciated technologies, I have a habit of tinkering
with old or not yet fully developed tech. Interestingly we have a huge problem right over
our heads (literally), and few people seem to be thinking about it. 

That problem, is quite simply, space. Well, there are other problems with space, like
the whole decompression/air/heat/radition thing, but what about the impact on
computer networking? NASA and now other privately funded programs have to send 
[radiation hardened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening) equipment into
space, but has anyone ever thought about how they talk to home? 

The answer is of course yes, and the problem is bigger than just small satellites
heading up into the stars. What about when we as a species are milling about the 
cosmos and have to send packets of information over long distances? 

Well, forntunately our friends at the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org) have already
got this one covered. [RFC4838](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4838) introduces 
a DTN, or Delay-Tolerant Network standard.

## What is DTN?

Well, DTN stands for Delay-Tolerant Network, the basic idea is that if a host doesn't
respond for an inordinate amount of time, that's just standard operating behaviour.
A situation like this may occur in space; light has a speed, and in the grand scheme
of things it is still prett slow. 

In environments that need a DTN, the standard internet protocols fall short in the
assumptions they make:
   - That end-to-end paths exist during communication
   - Timely responses and stable feedback is _the_ effective means for repairing errors
   - Applications don't worry about communication performace
   - A wide naming and addressing conventions
   - A provided security mechanism

And a host of other issues that just plain don't work in an environment where a DTN
is used. 

## The "Bundle Layer"

So we have the typical OSI model has seven layers: 

![OSI Model](/images/osi_model.jpg)

Though the the addition of RFC4838, a new "Bundle Layer" is added above the 
transport layer (or others), and below the application layer. The idea is that 
it performs as a persistant storage to combat the associated delays with objects
traveling in space. 

Similiar to more widely used standards, DTN has some basic builtin features: 
1. [URI](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)'s
2. Diagnostic and Management features
3. A basic security model

In theory it works similiar to the old ARPANET designs. It does however differ
drastically from ARPANET gateways in that the whole concept is layaer agnostic, 
and is focused on forwarding virtual messages. This is in contrast to the typical
packet switching that goes on.
