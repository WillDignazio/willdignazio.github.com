I've been reading various papers and abstracts on clustering concepts, as well
as some material on quorum (Paxos) and cluster management. A couple relevant 
things have popped up over the past couple days, namely 
[Ballast](http://people.nas.nasa.gov/~kolano/projects/ballast.html), a SSH load
balancing system, and [ION](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ion-dtn/). 

I'll cover some more on Ballast later, though for now I wanted to write a little
about how cool and interesting ION is. 

## Stop Looking At Your Feet!

I'm a fan of emerging or underappreciated technologies, I have a habit of tinkering
with old or not yet fully developed tech. Interestingly we have a huge problem right over
our heads (literally), and few people seem to be thinking about it. 

That problem, is quite simply, space. Well, there are other problems with space, like
the whole decompression/air/heat/radition thing, but what about the impact on
computer networking? NASA and now other privately funded programs have to send 
[radiation hardened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening) equipment into
space, but has anyone ever thought about how they talk to home? 

The answer is of course yes, and the problem is bigger than just small satellites
heading up into the stars. What about when we as a species are milling about the 
cosmos and have to send packets of information over long distances? 

Well, forntunately our friends at the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org) have already
got this one covered. [RFC4838](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4838) introduces 
a DTN, or Delay-Tolerant Network standard.

## What is DTN?

Well, DTN stands for Delay-Tolerant Network, the basic idea is that if a host doesn't
respond for an inordinate amount of time, that's just standard operating behaviour.
A situation like this may occur in space; light has a speed, and in the grand scheme
of things it is still pretty slow. 

In environments that need a DTN, the standard internet protocols fall short in the
assumptions they make:

   - That end-to-end paths exist during communication
   - Timely responses and stable feedback is _the_ effective means for repairing errors
   - Applications don't worry about communication performace
   - A wide naming and addressing conventions
   - A provided security mechanism

And a host of other issues that just plain don't work in an environment where a DTN
is used. pp

## The "Bundle Layer"

So we have the typical OSI model that has seven layers: 

![OSI Model](/images/osi_model.jpg)

Through RFC4838 a new "Bundle Layer" is added above the 
transport layer (or others), and below the application layer. The idea is that 
it performs as a persistant storage to combat the associated delays with objects
traveling in space. 

Similiar to more widely used standards, DTN has some basic builtin features: 

1. [URI](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)'s
2. Diagnostic and Management features
3. A basic security model

In theory it works similiar to the old ARPANET designs. It does however differ
drastically from ARPANET gateways in that the whole concept is layaer agnostic, 
and is focused on forwarding virtual messages. This is in contrast to the typical
packet switching that goes on. 

## Bundles

Similiar to other protocols, messages are put into arbitrary length units called
ADU's, or Application Data Units. These units are sent through the aformentioned 
Bundle Layer where they are turned into "bundles", which are forwarded by DTN 
nodes. These bundles contain two or more "blocks" of data, which may be direct 
application or other metadata. 

Now here's the interesting tidbit: bundles can be broken down further into "fragments", 
which are themselves perfect bundles. These fragments can be reassembled at any
point by any node with enough of the data. 

## But Wait, There's More!

There is a lot more to the standard, and I highly encourage reading some of the 
fascinating concepts and ideas in it. However, for the sake of this post, I'm going
to continue ahead and give a little talk on ION. I hope that what has been 
discussed thus far has layed enough of a groundwork to get an idea of what I'm
talking about. 

## ION

Theory and specs are nice, but let's be honest, it's not particularly useful if it's
just a concept in a text document. Fortunately, NASA has already implemented the DTN 
in a library commonly available as libion[-dev]. Hailing from the [JPL](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov),
you can find the open source code online on [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ion-dtn/).

ION stands for Interplanetary Overlay Network, and is their generic software distribution that makes 
its way into many an embedded system. I can't say for sure, but I can speculate that somewhere in the 
JPL, this plays a major role in navigation and communication.

The implementation, at least from what I have found thus far, is pretty by the book.
NASA has provided a convenient image of the inclusion of the DTN concept: 

![NASA_DTN](/images/NASA-DTN.png)

ION comes with the following packages: 
    
+ ici (Interplanetary Communication Infrastructure)
+ ltp (Licklider Transmission Protocol)
+ bp (Bundle Protocol)
+ dgr (Datagram Retransmission) 
+ ams (Asynchronous Message Service)
+ cfdp (CCSDS File Discovery Protocol) 
+ bss (Bundle Streaming Service)

These packages solve the flaws mentioned previously with other protocols, and a
how of other problems omitted or overlooked. 

The JPL pulled through and included some numbers for the data transfer rate, and 
said that one could expect a rate of 256kbps to 6Mbps. Not exactly stellar, but 
it beats not having any traffic at all.

## ION innards

ION has a focus on embedded devices, as such it takes in various design considerations that I 
won't go in depth on. I will however touch on the core principles:

+ Shared memory - ION must run on flight processors, meaning that it has to function on a real time operating system. 
  As such considerations have to be made in terms of sharing the same memory region, paying extra attention to locks, lists, etc.

+ Zero-Copy Procedures - The general goal and idea is to be more efficient about list and pointer usage, saving more space on already
cramped systems. 

+ Highly distributed processing - Being in shared memory makes it practical to distribute ION processing among multiple simple 
piplined tasks. This is as opposed to a single monolithic daemon. 

+ Portability - ION is compatible with Linux, VxWorks, BSD's, Solaris, Windows, on both 32 and 64 bit systems.
This is huge, as it means an easy to access, robust, and portable library that solves an huge problem. 

## Summary

I've only scratched the surface, the applications for ION and DTN are pretty, well, limitless. I really recommond
downloading the source for ION and taking a look at the docs portion. The DTN RFC, and the ION pdf's have some 
really great ideas and implementation details. 

I think space communication will be a big problem, through not overight. We already have a 
good start, but we aren't far from putting libraries like this to the test. Be it on the Moon, 
our back yard, or Mars. 

ION is a gift from NASA's JPL that if freely available on many Linux distributions, and can 
be used to provide DTN compatibility to systems of all kinds.
