## The Shingle Shanty Preserve
A beautiful preserve is nestled away in the Adirondacks, harboring a wealth of wildlife and scientific merit. This preserve, the Shingle Shanty Preserve, is approximately 23 square miles of pristine boreal (northern region) wetlands. Nine Miles west of Long Lake, NY, and just shy of the Brandreth State Park, the Preserve hosts many scientific studies throughout the year. Lying at the top of three primary watersheds, an area of land where all the water drains to another place, a recent study has shown that a rare moss is making a comeback – along with the moose. A study by Steve Langdon titled “Splachum Moss”  in the boreal regions of the Adirondacks, specifically the Shingle Shanty Reserve, gives remarks on the bizarre moss. While the studies funding source remains unavailable, it is worth noting that Langdon is currently a graduate student at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. The observations gathered via field notes, published in January 2013, describes the unlikely guest the Bull Moose has brought into the Preserve.

## The Bull Moose & Splachnum
Until the 1980's, the Bull Moose was not apparent in the region. However in as early as 2011 the Bull Moose had a made a surge in population, and in its wake has brought some interesting life. The return of the Splachnum mosses was heralded with the return of the Bull Moose, though through a less than glamorous way. The Splachnum moss are coprophilous: the greek word viscera, which translates to “innards.” In other words, this moss loves poop, or specifically, is a “excrament lover.” And as one may guess, the moss comes with the dung of the Bull Moose. 

The Bull Moose eats 40-60 pounds of food a day, which yields plenty of opportunity for the rare moss to live in. Interestingly, the spores of this moss are spread unlike any other: by insect. The Splachnum moss releases an attractant to flies, which then carry the spores to fresh dung piles. This process cycles, going from one end to other in an endless rhythm. The nitrogen content of the Moose dung is typically higher than cows and other similar animals. This creates an ideal environment for the moss to grow and thrive in an otherwise precarious situation.

## Conclusion
The Shingle Shanty Preserve can yield a wealth of useful, albeit disgusting, information. The Splachnum Moss is just one tidbit from the recent surge of Bull Moose population that scientists have found. By maintaining this pristine environment, scientists can continue to observe and study remarkable plants and animals. Not limited to just the Bull Moose and Splachnum Moss, the scientists of the Shingle Shanty Preserve continue to give insights into the Adirondacks and boreal regions of the United States.
