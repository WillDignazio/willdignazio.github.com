Ensō, as wikipedia so graciously provides, is the Japanese word for "circle." Being
as cliché as it [sounds,is] aside, it is a concept of Zen and Japanese aesthetics. I
like minimalism, and wouldn't you know it, the concept of Ensō is one of a quantum
expression, a minimalist excursion into reality.

Formally ensō symbolizes enlightenment, strength, elegance, the Universe, and [Mu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)).

I find it rather beautiful, ensō also symbolizes a moment where one's mind is ready to 
enter a state of creation. Free to create and synthesize something into reality. 

## Ensō Recursion

Well, how does this pertain to a technical nature? Frankly I correlate ensō to a mixture
of [Tail Recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call), [Automata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory),
and [Coroutines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine). Now, I'm just throwing fancy terms
around; I have an idea of just a circular function pattern. 

Heres a quick graph of the concept:

Conceptually, I am looking to make is a pattern in which an "ensō recursion" function takes 
the form of the crank of a state machine. This means that, for a finite series of states,
and an accompanying state machine, an ensō recursion function will yield the states in a 
circular fashion.
