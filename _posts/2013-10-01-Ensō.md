title: "Ensō Recursion"
category: posts

Ensō, as wikipedia so graciously provides, is the Japanese word for "circle." However,
as cliché as it sounds [is], it is itself a concept of Zen and Japanese aesthetics. I
like minimalism, and wouldn't you know it, but the concept of Ensō is one of a quantum
expression, a minimalist excursion into reality.

Formally, it symbolizes enlightenment, strenght, elegance, the Universe, and [Mu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)).

I find it rather beautiful, ensō also symbolizes a moment where ones mind is ready to 
enter a state of creation, simply free create, to synthesize something into reality. 

## Ensō Recursion

Well, how does this pertain to a technical nature? Frankly I correlate ensō to a mixture
of [Tail Recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call), [Automata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory),
and [Coroutines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine). Now, I'm just throwing fancy terms
around; I have an idea of just a circular function pattern. 

Heres a quick graph of the concept:
