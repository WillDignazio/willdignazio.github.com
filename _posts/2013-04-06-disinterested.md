title: "Disinterested"
category: posts

My current residence at the time of this post is the <a href="http://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>.
As my about page notes, I am currently studying Computer Science at the Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences.
My school provides an admittedly excellent education; they have a unique mixture of hands on applied studies and traditional lectures.

Personally I think that the vital experience of working cannot be sufficiently emulated in the classroom. Rather I think that I should
bring or have a workplace environment at school, such as the <a href="http://csh.rit.edu/">Computer Science House</a> (CSH). I won't in this post
divulge the inner workings of the house, but for context know that we are a group of professionals that use our interest in computing
to emulate real world scenarios. 

## Projects

Me any my colleagues have a strong propensity for both personal projects, typically in computing or engineering.
We research, prepare, develop, and deploy our projects on our house hosted services. Much of our infrastructure relies on projects 
that members have completed, such as <a href="https://github.com/cohoe/starrs">STARRS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/crawford/gatekeeper">Gatekeeper</a>,
and many others. Often these projects are deployed in real world scenarios, and land many of our members positions in full time employment,
or notoriety in the technical community. My fellow members include Chris Mason of btrfs, and John Resig of JQuery.

I hold projects very near and dear, my <a href="https://github.com/WillDignazio">Github</a> page hosts only a portion of my coding 
projects. Many I deem not yet acceptable, and are just sitting on my server or are in my home directory, waiting for completion. 

<b>However I am noticing a trend as I move along</b>

## The World Gets Bigger Every Day

It used to be that I had interest in just a couple things at a time; I enjoyed the time I had devoted to simple tinkering. I often 
emphasise to people now that the greatest thing you can show a person is not necessarily how to do something, but rather that 
something exists. 

I have an admittedly weak imagination, and for me the wild fantasies that I know about today would have inspired
me to great things much earlier in my life. Until I came to RIT, I simply took for granted the tools I used and the thought that
went behind them. I had never used linux *gasp*, and had never really considered it as I was in my comfort zone programming away
in C# (Not that there is much wrong with C#).

I'm not just talking about computing, but sciences, math, the whole STEM spiel is best done with a mentor to guide you on your way. 
Whether that person is your mother, father, brother, teacher, or family friend doesn't matter, simply removing the blindfold of 
your current understanding of the world is what matters most.

## Time Sharing Algorithms

The biggest problem I face today is having the time and interest to do things. Sounds contrary to what I just said, right? Well, think
of it this way:

I am a student, and I like to learn. Hell my goal is to even be a professor one day. I also like to program, and tinker with computers. 
What if every day you found something new, and all you did was find new, interesting things. Every day I may drop a project I started, or
change focus to something more interesting. Pile this on top of my studies, which over the past quarter (RIT is only just switching to semesters)
has been pretty rough; it doesn't bode well for getting things done. In fact, now that I know there is so much out there, I have 
to limit my interests, and <i>emulate</i> disinterest so that I may learn in depth about a particular topic. This is extremely frustrating to me.

I meet people all the time that just seem to be able to pick things up from the get-go, or have had the fortune of having a mentor from 
early childhood. Of course I'm jealous, but then again it's also fuel for the fire to catch up and learn what they learn. Often for me 
a better motivator is to tell me I can't or shouldn't do something. Most likely I'm going to go ahead and do it anyway.

My friends are well acquainted with my stubborn asshole phases. I apologize every now and then ;)
