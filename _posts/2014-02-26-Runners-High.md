I used to think running was a form of masochism, to be honest, now I'm only skeptical of that. In that ephemeral moment after a long period of running, there is a sensation known as runner’s high. You see, I’m in a not-so-dissimilar situation from many folks: I used to run daily after classes, for a period of roughly 4 months. After another 8 months of not doing daily runs (we'll call it a break), I started to get back into the grind. I found that while my physical health had not completely degraded, I now had a lower “tolerance” to runner’s high. That is, I got it earlier in my run, and it felt a little more intense than I remember. What is runner’s high, why do we get it during physical activity like running, and what causes it to lessen or become more intense over time?

## So What Is It?
Runner’s high is, in short, an exercise induced mood change. As I had found through a little research, it is a surprisingly uninvestigated area of physiology. A 2008 study done by several researchers in conjunction with the Technical University of München gathered various measurements and biological data from 10 athletes to study runner’s high. The study says long distance runners have reported that “it has the effect of stress reduce, anxiolysis (anti-anxiety), mood elevation, and reduced pain perception.” It’s in my opinion the “freebie” you get from running long enough. 
You may get in shape, but the runner’s high seems to be the only implicit reward along the way. A favored theory entitled the “endorphin hypothesis” speculates that runner’s high is the side effect of changes in central opioidergic transmission. In other words, it changes in the way your body handles pain, and the subsequent flood of endorphins. Endorphins are chemicals produced by your pituitary glands during a variety of activities. They resemble opiates, the main component of drugs like morphine and codeine, in the way they produce a feeling of well being. But what about the effects of runner's high over time, is it like some drugs in that you can build resistance to it?


## Effects of Runners High
Interestingly, whether people are even capable of building a tolerance to runner’s high is not a well explored area. Human produced chemicals, beta-endorphins, are known to over time create a tolerance when injected into lab rats. According to a somewhat dated, but still relevant 1981 study, lab rats over a period of 7-8 injections established a 50% tolerance. They needed to consume significantly higher concentrations of endorphins to get the same “buzz.” This translates to humans by insinuating we too can build a tolerance to the very same endorphins we release while experiencing the runner’s high. However, two researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Arizona in a 2013 study were the first to find that different mammals may or may not experience runner's high. We know that humans do, but they found dogs also experience the phenomena, and of course rats from the previous study. The researchers have postulated that this may be because of evolutionary benefits, like dogs needing to be able to keep up with their human partners. I'm inclined to agree, as they also found that animals like ferrets were not capable of producing the effect of runner's high after prolonged physical activity.


## Conclusion
Runner's high with man's best friend or not, I'm still going to pursue being in shape, eventually. The event known as the runner’s high occurs to many people at least once in their life, and maybe on a near daily basis to long distance runners. The cause has to do with complex, albeit poorly understood interactions of chemicals in your brain and the rest of the body. However what is known is that just like many other chemicals you can derive effects from, you can build a tolerance to the effects. As for the average runner, just keep on trucking. Know that when your body gives you a brief moment of respite after a long run, everything just fine.
