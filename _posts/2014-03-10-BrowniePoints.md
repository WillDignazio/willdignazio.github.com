## Q.  How can we improve disaster recovery with commercially available cameras?
## A. Between researchers and kids alike, being able to capture moments in time has been a fixation of all ages. First appearing in February of 1900, the Brownie camera produced by Eastman Kodak became very popular in U.S.. Selling millions of units, it enabled everyone to take photos of anything they wished. With every photo came a 2.25 square inch piece of data just waiting to be used. Today cameras have grown more complex, capable of producing highly detailed and beautiful photos. Eyewitness photography has become a key role in disaster response, doing more than just documenting what was lost or damaged. By incorporating public data with professional analysis, commercially available cameras can play a pivotal role in streamlining the process of disaster recovery.

The Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Research Computing department has shown that by using cheap commercial digital cameras, enough data can be generated to create 3D models useful to responders and prevention. Their paper, published in 2013, builds upon several years of past work to show how this can be done. By utilizing the high resolutions of modern cameras, or the 'clarity' of an image, many data points about a specific building or area can be extracted into useful objects. These data points, collectively called "point clouds‚Äù, must be heavily processed before they can be made into virtual models. The actual processing of all those data points is conquerable with just plain computing power, however the images themselves need to come from somewhere. 

Because high resolution digital cameras are so ubiquitous, both ground and airborne photos are highly accessible. The process starts with gathering the image data into a single data source; they can be emailed, uploaded, or gathered using any method of transferring data. The 3D data takes shape by using the data points from photos to generate the height and width of objects through a process called reconstruction. These are then used to piece together the scenario at hand, both interior and exterior, into a navigable virtual model. Finally textures are applied using the original image data so that the navigable model resembles what it will look like in real life. 

These models are ultimately given responders in order to build an idea of the kind of equipment necessary, and the hazards that may be faced. Without them, the process of evaluating a disaster scene would be much slower, and itself a dangerous process. By using commercially available cameras and publicly generated data, the RIT researchers have shown how to effectively expedite disaster recovery.
