In modern society, there is a price to pay for making roads and walkways safe in the Winter months. Deicing agents like rock salts must be used in large quantities to alleviate the threat of damage from vehicular collisions and pedestrian accidents. These agents do not simply disappear, rather they like any other mineral flow with water, and are washed away when the snow melts. Unfortunately, they have the property of harming nearby environments in both subtle and verbose ways, especially wetlands and marsh areas. 

## Studies
Deicing agents have been shown by a 2013 study from the Society of Wetland Scientists to have toxic effects on amphibians, and change the food chain of their environment. This study was done by two researchers in affiliation with the Department of Biology at the University of North Carolina Asheville, over a several month examination of outdoor wetland areas. The primary topic of this study was determining whether the spotted salamander was either more indirectly or directly affected by road deicing agents. The implications however divulge much more information about the impact of deicing agents on the environment.

## General Effects
The effects of deicing agents on salamanders may seem tangential to human interests, but are a good representation of salinization (the process of becoming salty) of fresh water. According to the Society of Wetland Scientists study, salinization has become a “substantial threat to aquatic life” (Petranka). That's not just salamanders, but all fish other and life forms that are in bodies of fresh water. In the spotted salamander's case, their larval, or 'adolescent' stage, was more tolerant to salt than their prey, but their growth was stunted by indirect effects of salinization while breeding. This may seem like an isolated disruption, but the effect can have ripples throughout a habitat's food chain.

## Problematic Freshwater Environments
The same study shows that in central and eastern North America, freshwater wetlands prove to be the primary breeding habitats for many species. These habitats are extremely susceptible to salt and deicer contamination (Petranka). It was once thought that natural Spring rains could naturally clean affected habitats, however they have shown this not to be the case. Researchers from the study conducted an outdoor mesocosm, an experimental tool where scientists bring a part of the natural environment into controlled conditions. In these experiments the salt content was carefully monitored and controlled while salamanders grew and hatched.  Interestingly, the salt appeared to have a negligible effect directly, the salamanders grew to be more salt tolerant than their relatives in more remote locations (Petranka). However, the mesocosms were left in a noticeably altered state. The food chain was changed such that the primary food source for the spotted salamander was reduced. This created altered altered patterns in mortality rate and breeding count, which can have a ripple effect that causes other species to stray from their environmental norms.

## Conclusion
The effects of deicing agents like road salts are still under heavy discussion among top scientists. The problem stems from there being a large set of components that make up a localized ecosystem; when you throw a rock into an engine, it's hard to tell where and what broke. The researchers of the Wetlands study have shown that while deicing agents may not affect the animals directly, it can influence the environment in negative ways very subtly over time. This may be by manipulating the food chain, or changing the breeding habits of local wildlife. The study has given an excellent glimpse into where our rock salt goes every Winter, and what the ramifications are by ignoring our actions on a yearly basis.
