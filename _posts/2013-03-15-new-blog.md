## Jekyll

I had been using jekyll for the previous iteration of my blog, however I had grown to dislike the look. This version is based off of the UP theme, another jekyll based theme aimed at content display.

With this setup I plan to host from [github pages](http://pages.github.com/), rather than host from a private server of mine. I suppose this will reduce downtime and makek maintenance easier, as I all I should have to do is push my latest posts.

## Statistics

With my previous blog, I had no idea how many viewers or potential commentators were looking at my blog. This time I have setup a google analytics tracker to gather data on searches and traversals to this website.
