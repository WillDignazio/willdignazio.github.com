title: DCPU - ALU

Just like registers, a central feature of a processor is the
[ALU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit), the Arithmetic
Logic Unit. This component does as one might expect: perform mathematical tasks
on values within the processor. This may be within the registers, or may be
values that are in specially allocated regions within physical memory. There
often is a compromise in how the ALU is implemented within a processor, often
there may be a simple implementation within the CPU itself, however a more
powerful one as a [Coprocessor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprocessor). This
allows designers to keep space and power consumption of the CPU to a minimum.

Often the ALU is capable of performing complex operations, i.e. more than just
addition and subraction. This may be from the ALU itself, or may be in conjunction
with other units, such as in the calculation of SHA functions. On a lighter note,
the ALU is typically responsible for XOR, AND, bit shifting, and complementing.

I tried to my implementation of an ALU as modular as possible, like the other
components, there is an emphasis on being able to select the function. It
sits as a component within the CPU, but is not integral, rather a module that
is interfaced by the other registers. As of my latest build, this is how the 
CPU sits:

I figured that for my purposes, I can assume that all the operations I need will
require at most two inputs. Currently I only have two implemented functions,
addition and subtraction. You can see the selection pin from the top of the ALU,
currently you can set the pin to 0 for subtraction, and 1 for addition. I left
the probe pins on for now, as I'm still testing it out for bugs.

## Usage

Like I said, I tried to focus on modularity for all my components within the CPU,
so the ALU requires a little TLC to be useful. Conceptually all it does is take
in two inputs and shove out the answer, but useful integration requires control
from a higher level.

The usage from the CPU is a little hacky: when an operation is decided from the 
instruction pins, the "Selection" pins decide from RA, and RB which banks to 
pull from. The answer is stored in the ARR (Arithmetic Return Register), within
the register selected from the instruction pins. While it's not pretty, you can
persist values across other operations without interfering with the values initially
calculated from the ALU.

## Implementation

The ALU from the initial under-the-hood inspection is very simple:

Input A and B are on the left, and the return pins are on the right. The selection
pin(s) are on the top left, attached to a decoder so that one can select the
function they wish to use. The decoder translates out to a 8 bit buffer chip that 
cuts the output if the function isn't selected. This means that at any given time
power is going to all operations, but the output of the one desired is allowed
through the output buffer.


## Addition

The addition uses 
[Full Adder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics) logic,
which is chained together into an 8 bit adder. This is a fairly common technique,
and is extendable to any size:

Like always, a simple two inputs and one output which allows it to be used as
a module within the ALU.

## Subtraction

Subtraction is done in a very similiar manner, I used a 
[Full Subtractor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractor), and gave it the basic
two input and one output model:

Each module within the ALU will be like this, such that all I have to do is rig
them up as a selectable function, and pipe the output to the ALU output.
