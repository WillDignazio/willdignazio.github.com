[Logisim](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/index.html)
is an incredibly useful tool that allows you to both design and simulate
circuits. It's primarily an educational tool, as it does not account for anything
but correct circuitry (high, low, cross). This post is more of a fanboy show and
tell, the site itself has an excellent set of resources on the program.

## Concepts

Logisim is pretty straightforward, on a new circuit document (.circ files), a
grid is presented where one can draw all circuits. An example is given below,
but the basic idea is that all the components and wires snap to the points on the
grid.

All wires are drawn at 90 degree angles, which can cause some problems when
the easiest or most elegant design requires a horizontal wire.

One of the better features is the ability to drag and drop the components onto
the grid. Although this is a double edged sword, as this is the only way to place
anything but wire. Even further though, once you have finished a circuit you can
turn it into a "subcircuit", which is effectively a new chip based on your design:

This allows you to take complex components and reduce them to manageable modules,
which are loadable as "Libraries" within another file. So if I create several
circuits within a single project, I can import that project itself as a "Library"
within another project. This will give access to all the subcircuits within that
project, and with that all of the work condensed into chips.

## Resources

The [Logisim](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/index.html) site has very 
extensive documentation, it of course covers the extensive amount of features and 
options.
